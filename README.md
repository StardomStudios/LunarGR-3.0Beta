An OpenGL-Based High level Graphics renderer for Roblox.

This graphics renderer is made for developers who want realistic but vibrant lighting for their games.
It is open source which means anyone can modify and make new versions of it for both personal and public
use. I'm currently working on enhancing it with a few bloxshade features in LunarGR-3.0Beta.
